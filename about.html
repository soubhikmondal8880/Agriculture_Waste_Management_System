            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>Our project addresses the critical issue of agricultural waste management. The agricultural sector generates significant amounts of waste, which if not managed properly, can lead to severe environmental impacts. Our system aims to provide an efficient, sustainable, and scalable solution to manage and recycle agricultural waste effectively.</p>
            
            <h2>Objectives</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>To develop a comprehensive system for managing agricultural waste efficiently.</li>
                <li>To promote the recycling and reuse of agricultural waste materials.</li>
                <li>To ensure compliance with environmental regulations and standards.</li>
                <li>To engage stakeholders in the agricultural sector to adopt sustainable practices.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
            <p>The current agricultural waste management practices are often inefficient, leading to increased environmental pollution and resource wastage. There is a need for a robust system that can handle the complexities of agricultural waste management, from collection and segregation to recycling and compliance.</p>
